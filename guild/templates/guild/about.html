                <h3>Our Legacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Established in 1989, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) is one of Uganda's premier public universities. Located in the beautiful southwestern town of Mbarara, the university has grown from humble beginnings to become a center of excellence in science, technology, innovation, and health sciences education in East Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The university was founded with a special mandate to address the regional and national shortages in medical personnel and advance technological innovations tailored to solving local challenges.

<!-- About Content Section -->
<section class="about-content">
    <h2>The MUST Students Guild</h2>
    <p>
        The MUST Students Guild serves as the official representative body for all students at Mbarara University of Science and Technology. Founded alongside the university in 1989, the Guild has evolved into a powerful platform that advocates for student welfare, promotes academic excellence, and fosters leadership development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our vision is to create a vibrant student community where every voice matters and where students actively participate in shaping the future of their education and society. The Guild operates on principles of inclusivity, accountability, and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        We organize various academic, cultural, sports, and social events throughout the academic year, including the annual MUST Cultural Gala, Science and Technology Exhibition, and Inter-Faculty Sports Tournament. These events provide opportunities for students to showcase their talents, exchange ideas, and build lasting connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Guild also plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between students and university administration, ensuring that student concerns are addressed promptly and effectively. Through regular consultations and feedback mechanisms, we work collaboratively with university leadership to improve the overall student experience at MUST.
